Image detection can identify abnormal growths with high accuracy as they can compare against a large database of images. This makes identifying cancers much easier for doctors. However, if the databse doesn't have a wide variety of demographics it might produce inaccurate results. For example, skin cancer has different appearances between skin tones.
