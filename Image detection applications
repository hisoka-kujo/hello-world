Airport security can detect forbidden items
CT scanners at airports would benefit from image detection and would make detecting contraband easier. If there were images on the databases of these forbidden items and the scanner was scanning at a high frame rate they would be able to detect items when the security guards might not the be able to. A limitation is that items are often hidden in between lots of clothes and other items, meaning that the scans will lack lots of detail: this means the software might not always detect the contrabant. One drawback. is that CT scanners scan in black and white, meaning the images on the database would also have to be black and white, making the items less disctinctive and more prone to error.

• Gaming and Entertainment
High frame rate allows you to make accurate scans of characters, useful for making high quality video games/ movies
Accurate image detection technology can improve CGI in video games and movies. If the image detection technology has a high frame rate, it can take accurate scans of the movement of humans and better quality animations. One limitation is that taking accurate humans scans is very expensive and it takes very long to animate people.

• Education and Learning
Image detection can be uses to create adaptive revision methods. This would be beneficial for languages, as you can create a flashcard system. When somebody gets the correct answer, the image detection technology can recognise that the person is strong on the topic and doesn't need to revise that topic as frequently as others. However, there are some drawbacks. If there are objects which are look similar/ if the pictures are blurry, the software may confuse the items with eachother, decreasing the quality of learning for the user.

• Transport and Navigation
Image detection is essential technology to self-driving cars. The technology in the car must have high frame rates, otherwise the car will get in to lots of accidents as it doesn't have an accurate image of the real time world. Image detection is also important for maps, such as google earth, which use image detection to make an accurate image of the real world based on images.A limitation of self driving cars is that they can only drive if they have the road maps on their database; this can lead to inconvencies for the driver. One drawback is that there might be some road vehicles which don't have any images on the database of the car, meaning they wouldn't be detected by the self-driving car, putting the passengers at risk.

• Medicine and Healthcare
Image detection can identify abnormal growths with high accuracy as they can compare against a large database of images. This makes identifying cancers much easier for doctors. However, if the database doesn't have a wide variety of demographics it might produce inaccurate results. For example, skin cancer has different appearances between skin tones, and this could possibly lead to a misdiagnosis.
